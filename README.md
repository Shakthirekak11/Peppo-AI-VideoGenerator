## Future Improvements

* **Video Streaming Optimization**
  Stream video output progressively (start playing before full file downloads).

* **Improvised RAG-Based Prompt Enrichment**
  Replace lightweight RAG with a full retrieval system (vector database + semantic search) to dynamically enrich prompts with contextual knowledge or style guides.

* **Advanced Controls**

  * Adjustable resolution (e.g., 480p / 720p / 1080p)
  * Frame rate customization
  * Multiple aspect ratios (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)

* **User Project History**
  Persistent storage (Supabase / Firebase) so users can log in and access all their past generations.

* **Creative Prompt Suggestions**
  Auto-suggest variations of prompts using OpenAI or HuggingFace models.

* **Multi-language Support**
  Allow prompts in multiple languages and auto-translate them into English for model input.

* **Billing / Usage Tracking**
  Limit free usage and integrate Stripe for paid tiers.
